\description{
Takes a function and searches for a global optimum with an evolutionary approach.

The package offers a comprehensive collection of building blocks for both
single- and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

\section{Evolutionary Optimization}{

The task of \bold{Global Optimization (GO)} is, given a set of objectives
\eqn{\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, \ldots, f_m\}} with \eqn{f_i : S \subseteq \mathbf{R}
\to \mathbf{R}}, \eqn{S} the region of feasible solutions, to find a solution
vector \eqn{\mathbf{x}^* \in S} with
\deqn{\mathbf{x}^* = arg\,min_{\mathbf{x}} (f_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_m(\mathbf{x}))}.
The defintion of argmin depends on the number of objectives in this context.
For a single objective, we are simply interested in minimizing the function
value, but in the case where \eqn{m \geq 2}, we need another term of optimality,
termed the Pareto-optimality. We do not want to dive in to deeply in multi-
objecitve optimization formalities here and refer the interested reader to
the literature. For now, let us assume, that we want to optimize a single
criterion, i.e., the task is
\deqn{\min_{\mathbf{x}} f(\mathbf{x})}.

However, many functions, which occur in practise of engineering, are hard
to optimize. In this case, evolutionary algorithms frequently get applicated
in practise, since these type of algorithms just base on function evaluations
and to not make any assumptions on the functions structure.

\section{Evolutionary Algorithms with ecr}{

All evolutionary algorithms are build up of the same evolutionary operators:
After initilizing an initial population, evolutionary operators, i.e., in particular
parental selection, recombination, mutation and survival selection are applied
until a stopping condition is met. However, until now, implementing EAs in R
has been a \dQuote{from scratch} work. This package offers a lot of ready to
use building blocks, which can easily be combined to set up evolutionary
algorithms, visualize results, monitor the optimization progress and compare
different evolutionary operators and/or parametrizations.
