Title: Evolutionary Computing in R
Description: This R package provides a powerful framework for evolutionary
    computing in R. The user can easily construct powerful evolutionary algorithms
    for tackling both single- and multi-objective problems by pluging in different
    predefined evolutionary building blocks, e. g., operators for mutation,
    recombination and selection with just a few lines of code. Your problem
    cannot be easily solved with a standard EA which works on real-valued vectors,
    permutations or binary strings? No problem, ecr has been developed with that in
    mind. Extending the framework with own operators is also possible. Additionaly
    there are various comfort functions, like monitoring, logging and more.
