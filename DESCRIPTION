Title: Evolutionary Computing in R.
Description: This R package provides a powerful framework for Evolutionary
    Computing in R. The user can solve his objective functions using predefined
    evolutionary operators, i. e., operators for mutation, recombination and so
    on for several common representations, with only a few lines of code.
    Extending the framework with own operators is also possible. Additionaly
    there are various control options such as the survival strategy elitism,
    which allow maximal flexibility. This package is much work in progress at
    the moment. In future releases, multi-objective evolutionary optimization
    will be possible as well.
